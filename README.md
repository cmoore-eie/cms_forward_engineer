plant_forward_engineer

The natural process once a class diagram has been created is to generate the code representing the classes in the model. The Forward Engineering takes the appropriately formatted Plant UML file and translates the information into an internal structure that is used to write the code. There are some limitations at the moment that will be removed as more functionality is added, yet the current implementation allows for relatively complex UML diagrams to be created and forward engineered.
